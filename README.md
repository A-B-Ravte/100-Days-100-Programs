🚀 100 Days of Applied AI & Automation
This repository tracks my journey from a Senior Software Engineer to a Full-Stack Applied AI Engineer. Each day, I solve two high-level Python programs focused on scalability, agentic workflows, and robust automation.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.12+

Concepts: Data Structures, Exception Handling, OOP, Agentic State Management, Regex.

Goal: Mastering production-grade code for AI Agents and Cloud Automation.

📅 Daily Progress Logs

Day 01: The Logic Warm-up
Program 1: Prime Number Filter with optimized square-root logic.

Key Learning: Algorithmic efficiency and basic control flow.

Day 02: Robust Data Preprocessing
Program 2: The Robust Data Cleaner.

Task: Cleaning "dirty" strings (currency symbols, whitespace) into valid floats.

Skills: Regex (re), defensive programming with try-except, and data type validation.

Key Learning: Agents fail when data is messy; robust cleaning is the first line of defense.

Day 03: Navigation & Path Traversal
Program 3: The Nested Config Mapper.

Task: Traversing deeply nested dictionaries using a "GPS-style" path (e.g., aws.region.status).

Skills: Pointer logic, split() methods, and handling "Key Not Found" edge cases.

Key Learning: Avoid expensive search algorithms when a direct path is provided. Use "Early Exit" patterns for efficiency.

Day 04: Agentic State & OOP
Program 4: The AIAgent Class.

Task: Building a class-based memory system for an AI Agent.

Skills: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), self referencing, and List Comprehensions for filtering history.

Key Learning: Agents require "state." Mastering classes is essential for frameworks like LangChain or AutoGPT.
